**At the moment, the project is being worked on a private server, the code will be available when the first alpha version is ready.** *(if everything goes right the alpha should be ready by the end of summer 2015)*

Windows/OSX Launchers
+++++++++++++++++++++

We cannot distribute hackedit as a standalone application because hackedit makes heavy use of the python ecosystem (e.g. for plugins management). The integration of python GUI application on Windows or OSX is not as good as on Linux (e.g. you cannot pin the app to the taksbar/dock,...). So we made a native launcher specifically for each platform.

**On windows**, you can grab an installer that will install a portable python installation ready with all python dependencies and a launcher executable that will use the portable installation (you can point it to another python installation). So just grab the installer, check the plugins/tools that you want and you're done.

**On OSX**, you need to install python3 and pyqt5 using a package manager such as homebrew and then use pip to install hackedit and its plugins, as indicated in the general install instructions. Then you can grab the launcher app and copy it to your Applications folder.
